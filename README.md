## Overview

So this project is something i've been meaning to do for a while. It's a "Modular" based system to include various systems you may want for your company as an all in one system, including a Billing System, Short URL maker, Website Uptime Monitor (V2.0!), Service Desk (Support tickets, also V2.0!) among others.

It's still very much in progress but I felt if I don't push now, it'll never happen, so, without further ado, I present IT Web Essentials V1.0

Please do be aware (not that I think it's going to happen) but this version most likely will not be upgradable (at least not easily) with the Database, I'd advise waiting until V2.0 to install this (hopefully soon) but if you really need it, install it and maybe I'll send upgrade instructions.

## Req's
1. Apache Web Server with PHP V 7.0+
2. MySQL Server
3. PDO-MYSQL Extention

## Installation

1. Install SQLINSTALL.sql
2. Configure UserConfig.php (only required thing is the Database connection, otherwise can leave blank)
3. That's it
(V2.0 should have an installer built in)

Ok stay tuned for V2.0!
